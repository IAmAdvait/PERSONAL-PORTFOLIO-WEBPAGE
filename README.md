*DESCRIPTION*: This code creates a clean and responsive **developer portfolio website** using only HTML and internal CSS. It has a single-page layout that includes all the essential sections needed to showcase a front-end developer’s work, skills, and contact information. The design is modern and visually appealing.

At the top, there is a sticky **navigation bar** that remains fixed while scrolling. It includes smooth links to various sections like Home, Projects, About, and Contact, making it easy to navigate the page. The nav also features a logo titled “DevPortfolio,” adding a personal brand touch.

The first thing users see is the **Hero section**, which introduces the developer with a short, confident message and a call-to-action button that encourages visitors to check out the projects. It is centered and well-spaced, creating a positive first impression.

Next is the **Projects section**, which uses a responsive grid layout to display three project cards. Each card features a title and a brief description, providing a quick overview of the developer’s work. The layout adjusts smoothly for different screen sizes thanks to `grid-template-columns: auto-fit`.

The **About section** adds a personal touch by offering a short bio about the developer (you, Advait!). It is written in a friendly tone that helps site visitors connect with you and your journey in web development.

Following that is the **Contact section**, which includes a simple contact form with fields for name, email, and message. It is styled neatly and centered, making it easy for potential clients or collaborators to reach out.

At the bottom, there is a **footer** with your name and a copyright note, providing a professional finishing touch.

Styling throughout the site uses CSS variables for colors, ensuring a consistent theme and making future tweaks easy. Elements like cards, buttons, and the navbar feature soft shadows, rounded corners, and hover effects to create a polished user experience.

Overall, this code forms an excellent foundation for a personal portfolio. It is clean, responsive, and easy to expand, whether you want to add animations, new projects, or connect it to a back end in the future.
